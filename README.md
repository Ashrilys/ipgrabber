# ipgrabber

a little ipgrabber i wrote which easly can be hosted on replit or other hosting services as soon as someone clicks on the link the ip adress with some other informations are getting send to your webhook 

## setup
if you are using https://replit.com then just create a new python project and paste the code into the main.py after that replace the text YOUR WEBHOOK HERE with your webhook and then press the green play button and then wait a coupple of minutes untill the repl is finished with setting up and giving you a link that link now is linked to your ipgrabber so as soon as someone clicks on the link they get logged and send to your webhook
